# Set Minimum Checkout Amount for WooCommerce
Prevent customers from completing their order by setting a minimum checkout amount. This is the order total or sub-total (defined in the settings) that must be met. If a customer attempts to reach the checkout, they are automatically sent back to the basket.

With this plugin you can:

- Specify the minimum checkout amount
- Determine the minimum checkout amount is against the customer's total or sub-total
- Customise the warning message when the minimum checkout amount is not set
- Set the minimum order rule to apply between two dates (start and end)

2. Activate through the 'Plugins' section
3. Once activated, go to WooCommerce -> Settings and navigate to 'Set minimum purchase settings'
